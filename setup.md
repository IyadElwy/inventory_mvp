3. /speckit.constitution We are building a microservice for inventory management. It should be based on Domain Driven Design principles. The Domain Model uses these Elements Aggregate, External System, Read Model, Command, Event, Policy, User. It should have a modular project strucutre. It should use the latest stable version of Fastapi with python 3.12. For the database use sqlite with sqlalchemy as ORM. Write unit tests using pytest as well as mocks with unittest.mock. In the end, the whole application should run in a docker container, so we will need a Dockerfile.

Constitution Created Successfully

  Version: 1.0.0
  Ratified: 2025-12-24

  Summary

  I've created your project constitution for the Inventory Management Microservice with the following core principles:

  Core Principles Established:

  1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) - Mandates use of Aggregates, Commands, Events, Policies, Read Models, External Systems, and User entities with clear boundaries
  2. Modular Architecture - Enforces independent testability, explicit interfaces, and inward-flowing dependencies (infrastructure → application → domain)
  3. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE) - Requires TDD with Red-Green-Refactor cycle using pytest and unittest.mock
  4. Technology Standards - Locks in Python 3.12, FastAPI (latest stable), SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM, pytest, and Docker
  5. API Contract Discipline - Requires Pydantic models, input validation, consistent error handling, and versioned breaking changes

  Additional Sections:
  - Code Quality & Testing (detailed test organization: unit/integration/contract)
  - Containerization (Docker requirements with multi-stage builds, non-root user, health checks)
  - Governance (amendment process, compliance checks, semantic versioning)

  Template Synchronization

  Updated:
  - .specify/templates/plan-template.md - Added specific constitution check gates for all 5 core principles

  Verified Compatible:
  - .specify/templates/spec-template.md - User story approach aligns with DDD and modular design
  - .specify/templates/tasks-template.md - Phase-based structure supports TDD and independent testing

  Suggested Commit Message

  docs: establish constitution v1.0.0 for inventory microservice

  - Add DDD principles (Aggregates, Commands, Events, Policies, Read Models)
  - Define modular architecture standards with dependency flow rules
  - Mandate test-first development (TDD) as non-negotiable
  - Lock technology stack: Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, pytest, Docker
  - Establish API contract discipline with Pydantic validation
  - Define code quality, testing, and containerization requirements
  - Update plan-template.md with constitution compliance gates

  All templates are now synchronized and ready for use with the /speckit.plan workflow.


4. Manuelles checken vom constitution.md und plan-template.md

5. Zu detailliert im constitution file: Technisches soll da nicht drin sein. Lass uns lieber eine neue constitution.md file generieren

6. /speckit.constitution We are building a microservice for inventory management. It should be based on Domain Driven Design principles. The Domain Model uses these Elements Aggregate, External System, Read Model, Command, Event, Policy, User.

● Perfect! The constitution has been successfully created and all templates have been synchronized. Let me provide you with a summary:

  Constitution Created Successfully

  Version: 1.0.0
  Ratified: 2025-12-24

  Summary

  I've created a streamlined, principle-focused project constitution for the Inventory Management Microservice that avoids overly prescriptive technical details and focuses on timeless architectural principles.

  Core Principles Established

  I. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
  - Mandates use of 7 standardized DDD elements: Aggregates, Commands, Events, Policies, Read Models, External Systems, and User entities
  - Each element has clear responsibilities and rules
  - Ensures business logic remains central and aligned with domain expertise

  II. Modular Architecture
  - Enforces independent testability and clear module boundaries
  - Requires inward dependency flow: infrastructure → application → domain
  - Domain layer must never depend on infrastructure or application layers

  III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
  - Mandatory Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle
  - Tests must be written before implementation
  - Coverage required for domain logic, services, and API contracts

  IV. API Contract Discipline
  - Explicit, versioned contracts required before implementation
  - Input validation at system boundaries
  - Auto-generated API documentation from contracts

  V. Simplicity First
  - Complexity must be justified
  - YAGNI principle enforced (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
  - Abstractions and patterns require concrete benefit justification

  Key Design Decisions

  Separation of Concerns: The constitution now clearly distinguishes between:
  - Timeless principles (in constitution.md) - architectural values that don't change
  - Technical decisions (in Technical Context section of plan-template.md) - language, frameworks, tools that may evolve

  This prevents the constitution from becoming outdated when technology choices change.

  Template Synchronization

  Updated:
  - .specify/templates/plan-template.md - Constitution Check section now includes all 5 principles with detailed compliance checkboxes

  Verified Compatible:
  - .specify/templates/spec-template.md - User story approach aligns with DDD and modular design
  - .specify/templates/tasks-template.md - Phase-based structure supports TDD and independent testing

  Suggested Commit Message

  docs: establish constitution v1.0.0 for inventory microservice

  - Define 5 core principles: DDD, Modular Architecture, Test-First, API Contracts, Simplicity
  - Mandate 7 DDD elements: Aggregates, Commands, Events, Policies, Read Models, External Systems, User
  - Enforce inward dependency flow and domain layer independence
  - Require TDD with Red-Green-Refactor cycle (non-negotiable)
  - Separate timeless principles from technical decisions
  - Update plan-template.md with comprehensive constitution compliance checks

  All templates are now synchronized and ready for use with the /speckit.plan and other speckit workflows.

7. /speckit.specify Create a Restapi for this microservice. It should have a modular project strucutre. It should use the latest stable version of Fastapi with python 3.12. For the database use sqlite with sqlalchemy as ORM. Use pydantic models for data modelling. Write unit tests using pytest as well as mocks with unittest.mock. In the end, the whole application should run in a docker container, so we will need a Dockerfile. 

● Feature Specification Created Successfully ✅

  Branch: 001-inventory-rest-api
  Spec File: /workspaces/inventory_mvp/specs/001-inventory-rest-api/spec.md
  Checklist: /workspaces/inventory_mvp/specs/001-inventory-rest-api/checklists/requirements.md

  Summary

  I've created a comprehensive feature specification for the Inventory Management REST API that focuses on business requirements and user needs rather than implementation details.

  Key Features Specified

  5 User Stories (prioritized for independent delivery):

  1. P1 - Check Inventory Availability: Query stock levels before orders
  2. P1 - Reserve Inventory for Orders: Hold stock atomically for pending orders
  3. P2 - Release Reserved Inventory: Free up cancelled order reservations
  4. P2 - Adjust Inventory Levels: Manual corrections for stock reconciliation
  5. P3 - Monitor Low Stock Alerts: Proactive restocking notifications

  Functional Requirements

  - 16 functional requirements covering API endpoints, validation, events, and persistence
  - All requirements aligned with DDD principles from the constitution
  - Commands: ReserveInventory, ReleaseInventory, AdjustInventory
  - Events: InventoryReserved, InventoryReleased, InventoryAdjusted, LowStockDetected
  - Read Models: InventoryStatus, LowStockList

  Success Criteria (Technology-Agnostic)

  - Response time: <100ms for 95% of requests
  - Concurrency: Handle 1000 concurrent requests atomically
  - Throughput: 100 requests/second without degradation
  - Data persistence: Zero data loss on restart
  - Error handling: 100% clear error messages
  - Business invariants: Zero violations enforced

  Validation Results ✅

  All quality checks passed:
  - ✅ No implementation details in specification
  - ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
  - ✅ All requirements testable and unambiguous
  - ✅ Success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic
  - ✅ Scope clearly bounded with assumptions and out-of-scope items
  - ✅ User stories independently testable

  What Was Excluded (Correctly)

  The specification intentionally excludes implementation details like:
  - Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic (technical stack)
  - pytest, unittest.mock (testing tools)
  - Docker, Dockerfile (deployment)
  - Modular project structure (code organization)

  These will be documented in the plan.md Technical Context section when you run /speckit.plan.

  Ready for Next Phase

  The specification is ready for:
  - /speckit.plan - Create implementation plan with technical context (Python, FastAPI, SQLite, Docker, etc.)
  - /speckit.clarify - Optional if you want to refine requirements further

  The plan phase will incorporate your technical requirements (FastAPI, Python 3.12, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, pytest, Docker) into the Technical Context and Constitution Check sections.

8. Wir merken, dass die DDD prinzipien immer rausgelassen werden und deshalb wir das requirements.md anpassen mussten. Das spec.md

9. Wir merken dass keine technische anforderungen reingenommen wurden obwohl wir diese spezifiziert haben. Das KI modell erkennt, dass diese hier nicht in dieser Phase gehören und packt diese nicht rein.

10. /speckit.plan The project should have a modular project strucutre. It should use the latest stable version of Fastapi with python 3.12. For the database use sqlite with sqlalchemy as ORM. Use pydantic models for data modelling. Write unit tests using pytest as well as mocks with unittest.mock. In the end, the whole application should run in a docker container, so we will need a Dockerfile.

● Implementation Plan Completed Successfully ✅

  Branch: 001-inventory-rest-api
  Plan File: /workspaces/inventory_mvp/specs/001-inventory-rest-api/plan.md

  Next Steps

  Ready for task generation:
  /speckit.tasks

  This will generate tasks.md with:
  - Detailed implementation tasks organized by user story
  - Dependency-ordered phases (Setup → Foundational → User Stories)
  - Parallel execution opportunities marked with [P]
  - TDD-first approach (tests before implementation)

  The plan has passed all constitutional gates and is ready for implementation! 🎉


11. /speckit.tasks

  I've generated a comprehensive, dependency-ordered task list with 92 tasks organized by user story for independent implementation and testing.

  Task Breakdown by Phase

  Phase 1: Setup - 14 tasks
  - Project structure creation (directories, config files)
  - Dependencies setup (requirements.txt, pytest.ini)

  Phase 2: Foundational - 11 tasks ⚠️ BLOCKING
  - Domain model foundation (exceptions, events, commands)

  - Database models and FastAPI setup
  - CRITICAL: All user stories blocked until this completes

  Phase 3: User Story 1 (P1) - 10 tasks 🎯 MVP
  - Check Inventory Availability
  - 5 test tasks (TDD approach)
  - 5 implementation tasks
  - Independent deliverable: Query endpoint working

  Phase 4: User Story 2 (P1) - 12 tasks
  - Reserve Inventory for Orders
  - 6 test tasks
  - 6 implementation tasks (includes event emission)
  - Can run in parallel with US1 after Foundational

  Phase 5: User Story 3 (P2) - 10 tasks
  - Release Reserved Inventory
  - 5 test tasks
  - 5 implementation tasks

  Phase 6: User Story 4 (P2) - 11 tasks

  Phase 8: Polish - 12 tasks
  - Logging, event persistence, migrations
  - Docker containerization
  - Performance testing
  - Health checks and CORS

  Key Features

  ✅ Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  - All 5 user stories include comprehensive test tasks written BEFORE implementation
  - Tests follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
  - 52 test tasks total (unit, integration, contract)
  - Tests use pytest + unittest.mock as specified

  ✅ Proper Task Format
  - Every task follows checklist format: - [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
  - Example: - [ ] T026 [P] [US1] Write unit test for Inventory aggregate creation in tests/unit/test_inventory_aggregate.py
  - 32 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
  - All user story tasks tagged with [US1] through [US5]

  ✅ Independent User Stories
  - Each story can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
  - Clear "Independent Test" criteria for each story
  - Checkpoints after each story completion
  - No cross-story dependencies

  ✅ Parallel Execution Opportunities
  - 32 tasks can run in parallel (marked with [P])
  - Setup tasks: T003-T012 (10 parallel)
  - Foundational tasks: T015-T019, T023 (6 parallel)
  - Test tasks within stories (all [P] marked)
  - Polish tasks: T081-T088 (8 parallel)

  ✅ Complete Dependency Graph
  - Phase dependencies clearly documented
  - User story execution order defined
  - Within-story task sequencing specified
  - Parallel team strategy provided

  Delivery Strategies

  MVP First (35 tasks):
  - Setup (14 tasks)
  - Foundational (11 tasks)
  - User Story 1 only (10 tasks)
  - Result: Working query endpoint for inventory status

  P1 Stories (57 tasks):
  - Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2
  - Result: Query + Reserve operations working
  - Core inventory management functional

  Full Feature (92 tasks):
  - All 5 user stories + Polish
  - Result: Complete inventory management microservice
  - Production-ready with Docker, logging, performance validated

  Implementation Workflow

  TDD Cycle Example (per user story):
  # 1. RED: Write failing tests
  pytest tests/unit/test_inventory_aggregate.py -v
  # Expected: FAILED (not implemented)

  # 2. GREEN: Implement to pass
  # Write code in src/domain/inventory.py
  pytest tests/unit/test_inventory_aggregate.py -v
  # Expected: PASSED

  # 3. REFACTOR: Improve while keeping tests green
  # Refactor implementation
  pytest tests/unit/test_inventory_aggregate.py -v
  # Expected: All PASSED

  File Paths Included

  Every task includes exact file paths:
  - src/domain/inventory.py
  - src/application/inventory_service.py
  - src/infrastructure/api/routes.py
  - tests/unit/test_inventory_aggregate.py
  - tests/integration/test_inventory_workflows.py
  - tests/contract/test_inventory_api.py

  Validation

  ✅ Format: All 92 tasks follow strict checklist format with checkboxes
  ✅ IDs: Sequential T001-T092
  ✅ Labels: [P] for parallel, [US1]-[US5] for user stories
  ✅ Paths: Every task includes specific file paths
  ✅ Organization: Grouped by user story for independent delivery
  ✅ TDD: Tests written before implementation (52 test tasks)
  ✅ Dependencies: Clear phase and story dependencies documented

  Next Steps

  Start Implementation:
  # Begin with MVP (User Story 1 only)
  # Complete T001-T035 (Setup + Foundational + US1)

  # Or start with Setup phase
  # Complete T001-T014

  Track Progress:
  - Check off tasks as completed in tasks.md
  - Run tests frequently to verify progress
  - Deploy after each user story for incremental value

  The task list is ready for immediate execution with clear, actionable items that an LLM or developer can complete independently! 🎉

  /speckit.implement Phase 2

  Or continue with installation:
  # Install dependencies
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  # Verify installation
  pytest --version
  python -c "import fastapi; print(f'FastAPI {fastapi.__version__}')"

  All Phase 1 tasks are marked as complete ✅ in tasks.md. The project foundation is now ready for Phase 2 implementation!

/speckit.implement Phase 2

● Excellent! All Phase 2 tasks are complete. Now let me mark them as completed in the tasks.md file and validate:

● Phase 3 Complete - User Story 1 (Check Inventory Availability)

  Phase 3 implementation is complete! All 10 tasks (T026-T035) have been successfully implemented and tested following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

  Summary

  Implemented Features:
  - User Story 1: Check Inventory Availability (Priority P1)
  - GET /v1/inventory/{product_id} API endpoint
  - Complete domain model with business rules
  - Full test coverage (unit, integration, contract)

  Files Created:
  1. src/domain/inventory.py - Inventory aggregate with validation
  2. src/application/inventory_service.py - Application service for inventory queries
  3. src/infrastructure/api/routes.py - FastAPI route handlers
  4. tests/unit/test_inventory_aggregate.py - 9 unit tests
  5. tests/integration/test_inventory_workflows.py - 3 integration tests
  6. tests/contract/test_inventory_api.py - 3 contract tests

  Test Results:
  - ✅ 15/15 tests passing
  - ✅ Unit tests: 9 passed (domain logic)
  - ✅ Integration tests: 3 passed (service workflows)
  - ✅ Contract tests: 3 passed (API endpoints)
  - ✅ Code coverage: 68% overall

  Key Implementation Details:

  1. Domain Layer (src/domain/inventory.py:1-54):
    - Inventory aggregate with business invariants
    - Validates: non-negative quantities, reserved ≤ total
    - Computed property: available_quantity = total - reserved
  2. Application Layer (src/application/inventory_service.py:1-53):
    - get_inventory() method retrieves inventory by product_id
    - Raises InventoryNotFoundError for non-existent products
    - Coordinates between repository and event publisher
  3. API Layer (src/infrastructure/api/routes.py:1-72):
    - GET /v1/inventory/{product_id} endpoint
    - Returns InventoryResponse with current status
    - Error handling: 404 for not found, 500 for server errors

  Checkpoint Reached:
  User Story 1 is now fully functional and independently testable. The API can query inventory status and calculate available quantities correctly.

  Next Steps:
  Phase 4: User Story 2 - Reserve Inventory for Orders (Priority P1)
  - Tasks T036-T047 (12 tasks)
  - Implements atomic inventory reservation
  - Prevents overselling through database locking
